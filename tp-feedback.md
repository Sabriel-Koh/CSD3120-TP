# TP Feedback for Team 6
                                        
**TP Grade**: A+
                                        
## Immersion Design
articulated design that targets specific user experiences that relates well to immersion concepts
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is clearly related to immersion design and works well
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed with good quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly and meticulously analysed to form conclusions leading to a meaningful articulation of future work
                                        
## Documentation
a comprehensive README (clear/detailed instructions and architecture) and a well-made video demo (well-scripted articulations with good footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
demonstrated good software development processes across all aspects of creating/delegating/monitoring work packets across members collaboratively
                                        
## Other feedback
Well done! Good design and implementation of the app.

Excellent effort in applying immersion constructs learned from class and performing a detailed analysis across the construct dimensions! That well makes up for the lack of quantity (which should normally be 30 if you are using numbers :) ). Another area for improvement is to perform a consolidated analysis of your qualitative responses. But really good job nevertheless for the user evaluation part!

Documentation - Good and efficient documentation. Clear instruction on how to get to the documentation repos.
Software engineering methodology can be evidence by the documentation submitted.
