# CSD3120 Team Project (Group 6)
This repository contains an interactive application developed by Team 6 for our `CSD3120 - Introduction to Virtual Reality` team project. It serves as both an immersive application, and a research project to gather qualitative data on user studies to both assess, and enhance the `immersion` of the application.
To learn more about our research processes, you can head to the our [GitHub Wiki Page]().

## Project Brief
// Todo give a brief introduction to the project and application

## Prerequisites
To run this application smoothly and without issues, we recommend that you use an `Oculus Quest 2` and a compatible device that meets the minimum system requirements. We recommend this device as the application has been extensively tested with this device.
You will also need to have `Unity` installed, and have at least `Version 2020.3 or later` as the `XR Interaction Toolkit` is only compatible for these versions.
